## Project Description Template

The purpose of this Project Description is to present the ideas proposed and decisions made during the preliminary envisioning and inception phase of the project. The goal is to analyze an initial concept proposal at a strategic level of detail and attain/compose an agreement between the project team members and the project customer (mentors and instructors) on the desired solution and overall project direction.

This template proposal contains a number of sections, which you can edit/modify/add/delete/organize as you like.  Some key sections weâ€™d like to have in the proposal are:

- Vision: An executive summary of the vision, goals, users, and general scope of the intended project.

- Solution Concept: the approach the project team will take to meet the business needs. This section also provides an overview of the architectural and technical designs made for implementing the project.

- Scope: the boundary of the solution defined by itemizing the intended features and functions in detail, determining what is out of scope, a release strategy and possibly the criteria by which the solution will be accepted by users and operations.

Project Proposal can be used during the follow-up analysis and design meetings to give context to efforts of more detailed technical specifications and plans. It provides a clear direction for the project team; outlines project goals, priorities, and constraints; and sets expectations.

## 1.   Vision and Goals Of The Project:

Hydra will be a framework for applications in the cloud to mitigate DDoS attacks and provider outages by providing resiliency at multiple levels both intra- and cross-clouds. If parts of AWS or GCP go down, the application itself should be alive and kicking.

## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project:

This section describes the principal user roles of the project together with the key characteristics of these roles. This information will inform the design and the user scenarios. A complete set of roles helps in ensuring that high-level requirements can be identified in the product backlog.

## 3.   Scope and Features Of The Project:

- Request-level load balancing and queueing between hosts.
- Frequent heartbeat monitoring to assess the status of hosts to direct, re-reroute, queue, and cache requests.
- Distributed writes to all database solutions.
- Ability to read from any healthy database server.
- Eventual consistency via replication / multi-read comparisons.

## 4. Solution Concept

This section provides a high-level outline of the solution.

Global Architectural Structure Of the Project:

This section provides a high-level architecture or a conceptual diagram showing the scope of the solution. If wireframes or visuals have already been done, this section could also be used to show how the intended solution will look. This section also provides a walkthrough explanation of the architectural structure.

 

Design Implications and Discussion:

This section discusses the implications and reasons of the design decisions made during the global architecture design.

## 5. Acceptance criteria

MVP:

1) Host heartbeating for uptime and load monitoring
2) Request load balancing based on heartbeat data
3) Turning off host instances should not bork the application

## 6.  Release Planning:

Release planning section describes how the project will deliver incremental sets of features and functions in a series of releases to completion. Identification of user stories associated with iterations that will ease/guide sprint planning sessions is encouraged. Higher level details for the first iteration is expected.
