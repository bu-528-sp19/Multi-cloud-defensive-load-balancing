Using Docker

To build the docker image:
docker build -t garage .
//Note: the docker build command looks for a Dockerfile, so the Dockerfile must be in the working directory.

To run container:
docker run -p 8888:8888 garage

To stop a container:
docker stop container-name

To remove a running container:
docker rm container-name

To remove a docker image:
docker rmi garage
